\section{Introduction}


\section{Time Management}

\subsection{Description - What happened? What is being examined?}

One of my weakness I'll be examining is time management. With all tasks it is crucial to follow a strict and thoughtful planning arrangement which accounts for all aspects of the project. For me, the relevance of this issue was for my final deadlines.

\subsection{How has this impacted my learning and projects?}

During my projects, I have found that my allocated work time had been misplaced. In context of my tinkering graphics and audio tasks, the allocated time spent on these coding sessions were more focused on research of ideas and techniques rather than practical applications. This not only lead to a low quality of work but also low quantity too. While time was spent on this tasks as requested, the allocation of this time was not evenly distributed and so hindered the overall project. In addition to this, when code started to malfunction, further research overtook practical testing of ideas.

\section{Critic Ability}

\subsection{Description - What happened? What is being examined?}

During my projects, it has been crucial to evaluate both my work and my peers. While struggling to maintain confidence in my own work and overall course content, I felt unprepared to evaluate others work.
