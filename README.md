# Comp110 Worksheets
Here are the following weekly report on my production and development of my worksheets.

##Week 1 - Worksheet 1 _SpaceChem_
During the introduction of each section, I learned new ways to reduce the number of symbols, or functions, required to complete each circuit. While following and attempting to test out different approaches to different required molecule shapes or reformation, I began to adapt faster solutions with fewer symbols used.

This can be demonstrated by achieving the High Performance for "Every Day Is The First Day" which met the criteria of creating a circuit with fewer than 300 cycles. These skills for reducing the number of functions required to tackle a problem and find a solution are going to be useful when constructing code.

##Week 2
