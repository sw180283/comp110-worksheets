# Comp110 Worksheets
Here are the following weekly report on my production and development of my worksheets.

##Week 1 - Worksheet 1 _SpaceChem_
During the introduction of each section, I learned new ways to reduce the number of symbols, or functions, required to complete each circuit. While following and attempting to test out different approaches to different required molecule shapes or reformation, I began to adapt faster solutions with fewer symbols used.

This can be demonstrated by achieving the High Performance for "Every Day Is The First Day" which met the criteria of creating a circuit with fewer than 300 cycles. These skills for reducing the number of functions required to tackle a problem and find a solution are going to be useful when constructing code.

##Week 2 - Strings
Within COMP120 we began to experiment with the introduction of string text, which creates a word saved into the JES programme that is assigned to a particular value. For example if x = "apple", then the resulting _print_ function would look give this: 

print x  
apple

When combining this string format, it is possible to create more interesting uses when considering manipulation. When using a similar approach to maths in JES, the same can be done for combining strings. If x = "apple" and y = "fruit" then the resulting addition would print as:

print x+y  
applefruit.

This is an example of how I have started to learn the basics about JES and how it can be used and improved.

##Week 3 - Games Platform History Essay

The focus of this week was the start of our first essay, with group presentations that included work that our team had assembled together with individual focus on one console of the specified generation. It was a chance at our first group project and allowed different findings to group together which would help our research into our essay.

After being given research information about how to collect and reference our sources, I have been given the task of researching into the SG-1000.

After our presentation, I would have improved it with better group communication as there were some topics covered twice during individual research. Also, the length of our presentation could have been simplified which would have meant that there'd be no reading from the screen.

##Week 4 - Image Manipulation

Additional uses for JES have been demonstrated, such as the use of turtles to generate images and also image maniupulation. Altering the colour and pixel position would have great use for our COMP120 assignment which required image manipulation.

After being assigned our pair programming groups, we have decided to compelte the tasks of creating an interactive mood board and power-ups. Both of these tasks involve sci-fi genre so interest our group.
