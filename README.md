# Comp110 Worksheets
Here are the following weekly report on my production and development of my worksheets.

##Week 1 - Worksheet 1 _SpaceChem_
During the introduction of each section, I learned new ways to reduce the number of symbols, or functions, required to complete each circuit. While following and attempting to test out different approaches to different required molecule shapes or reformation, I began to adapt faster solutions with fewer symbols used.

This can be demonstrated by achieving the High Performance for "Every Day Is The First Day" which met the criteria of creating a circuit with fewer than 300 cycles. These skills for reducing the number of functions required to tackle a problem and find a solution are going to be useful when constructing code.

##Week 2 - Strings
Within COMP120 we began to experiment with the introduction of string text, which creates a word saved into the JES programme that is assigned to a particular value. For example if x = "apple", then the resulting _print_ function would look give this: 
```
print x  
apple
```
When combining this string format, it is possible to create more interesting uses when considering manipulation. When using a similar approach to maths in JES, the same can be done for combining strings. If x = "apple" and y = "fruit" then the resulting addition would print as:
```
print x+y  
applefruit.
```
This is an example of how I have started to learn the basics about JES and how it can be used and improved.

##Week 3 - Games Platform History Essay

The focus of this week was the start of our first essay, with group presentations that included work that our team had assembled together with individual focus on one console of the specified generation. It was a chance at our first group project and allowed different findings to group together which would help our research into our essay.

After being given research information about how to collect and reference our sources, I have been given the task of researching into the SG-1000.

After our presentation, I would have improved it with better group communication as there were some topics covered twice during individual research. Also, the length of our presentation could have been simplified which would have meant that there'd be no reading from the screen.

##Week 4 - Image Manipulation

Additional uses for JES have been demonstrated, such as the use of turtles to generate images and also image maniupulation. Altering the colour and pixel position would have great use for our COMP120 assignment which required image manipulation.

After being assigned our pair programming groups, we have decided to compelte the tasks of creating an interactive mood board and power-ups. Both of these tasks involve sci-fi genre so interest our group.

##Week 5 - Picture Techniques & Essay Peer Reviews

To complete our COMP120 assignment, we learnt more about picture techniques including changing colours based on certain colour ranges, found colour distances between two colours and also restricted these changes to certain pixels. I found this task difficult, confusing my getColor function assuming that getColor(black) was required instead of actually black.getColor().

I also learned that when creating a function that requires the same colour more than once, and reuse code, the method could include the colour as a variable. E.g. def removeRedEye(color1,color2): where color1.getColor() is used instead.

When learning the principle of Agile, including user stories, scrum & sprints; the process of backlog and assigning tasks are useful when maintaining achievable pace. Realistic pace is the goal not doubling work. Brook's Law gives reason to Agile, more people joining a group half way through a project reduces pace.

Later in the week, we used peer review to evaluate our essays. It was useful to see how other students had approached their essay, but allowed me to review others reviews using the marking criteria. This meant that I could use the feedback that other people gave me but also was not able to critically review my own work using the same marking criteria.

##Week R - Sprint & Worksheet 2

The creative coding task was difficult and I required a lot of research and additional material to make me feel confident to even start writing code. There were numerous occasations where I made a typo which was later corrected, but having caused a great amount of time wasted.

While trying to keep the objective in mind, it was interesting to compare with what my peers had created and attempted to achieve and display using code and comments. Because my project was different to those that I saw, it made my task completely different so that I still had to be creative but gave me the ideas I needed to layout my code.

Creating the worksheets was partly confusing, as the depth of a flowchart is debatable, and the content is rather vague. I attempts to create a concise yet description guide on the flow of my project. The same was done for the pseudo code.

##Week 6

We were given an introduction to databases, OOP and additional guidance with our academic writing.

When discussing the ability to use classes, it provided a way to improve my sophistication of my tinkering projects. I plan on using classes and referencing to make my code cleaner and easier to manipulate.

With databases, it was my first enconunter with the terminology so there was a lot to learn. I should ask for futher guidance for terms I am still unsure of. The referencing of keys is similar to that of classes but I am still unsure of the difference between a primary and foreign key.

The SQL language is a difficult new language for me to understand, so I require additional study time to make sure I am confident in this language.

I have also been assigned a new essay task so I should start researching and drafting my essay topic of PCG.

##Week 7

The additional information on referencing and how python uses classes was helpful in using them in my coding task. The use of access control was also useful in understand when and where a class can be referenced.

##Week 8

We learned about memory allocation, usage and how to rewrite or expand memory space. We also looked at the use of lists and tuples, however it seemed confusing how pythons approach was different to other coding languages. The use of dictionaries was a useful method to consider when thinking about databases and creating referencing.

##Week 9

The use of modules provided more opportunity for making my tinkering code more sophisticated as it allowed for calling a module from a different program, similar to how kivy calls other files into the code.

The ability to predict an error is useful in giving guidance to the user should an error occur.

We also examined the execution time of a program and how this scales with the project size. I am still unsure of the use of Big O and should ask for further guidance on this as I struggled during the socrative quiz.

Having studied A level maths, I understood the common complexity classes graphs.

##Week 10

Today we used peer review to give guidance to the final draft of our essays. I found this a useful task as I should see how other students approach to the same or different topic essay.
